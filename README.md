Programming Assignment #1
Install your most preferred Java IDE, and implement textbook (9/E) problem 3.16 in page 101. The problem statement is reproduced next:
3.16 (Target-Heart-Rate Calculator) While exercising, you can use a heart-rate monitor to see that your heart rate stays within a safe range suggested
by your trainers and doctors. According to the American Heart Association (AHA), the formula for calculating your maximum heart rate in beats per
minute is 220 minus your age in years. Your target heart rate is a range that’s 50-85% of your maximum heart rate. Note: These formulas are estimates
provided by the AHA. Maximum and target heart rates may vary based on the health, fitness and gender of the individual. Always consult a physician or
qualified health care professional before beginning or modifying an exercise program.
Create a class called HeartRates. The class attributes should include the person’s first name, last name and date of birth (consisting of separate
attributes for the month, day and year of birth). Your class should have a constructor that receives this data as parameters. For each attribute provide set
and get methods. The class also should include a method that calculates and returns the person’s age (in years), a method that calculates and returns
the person’s maximum heart rate and a method that calculates and returns the person’s target heart rate. Write a Java application that prompts for the
person’s information, instantiates an object of class HeartRates and prints the information from that object—including the person’s first name, last name
and date of birth—then calculates and prints the person’s age in (years), maximum heart rate and target-heart-rate range.
Requirements
Realize your implementation that satisfies the following minimal requirements:
2 pt: properly exhibits right logic, i.e., readable and compilable coding
2 pt: properly reads personal information from terminal
2 pt: properly writes maximum and target heart rates to terminal
2 pt: properly writes error message to terminal in response to incorrect input
extra credit: properly interfaces with dialog boxes (see 3.19)
Look at the 3rd implementation of this which is simplest for date validation.
Submission
You are to hand in your development by Wednesday 18:00 P.M. February 13th, i.e., just before the lecture. Once you have done all your work, email
me your zipped project file or Java source file(s). You can submit your work by Friday 18:00 P.M. February 15th (with 25% score deduction).
